# ViPSN
ViPSN is a vibration-powered sensing node as a programmable IoT platform for battery-free sensing and transmitting. It leverages the exploitation and utilization of ambient vibration energy by using a piezoelectric transducer. The study on ViPSN provides a new paradigm for the design and operation of the battery-free IoT systems based on vibration energy harvesting technology.
It encapsulates four units: the vibration source unit (VSU), interface circuit unit (ICU), energy management unit (EMU), and energy user unit (EUU). 

## System overview
The **VSU** is composed of two parts: transducer and vibrator.
The piezoelectric transducer is made of a circular low-cost piezoelectric buzzer, whose rim is fixed on the moving part of the resonant speaker.
A mass is bonded in the center of the round-shape transducer. 
A commercial resonant speaker serves as the vibrator, which is utilized to generate the vibrations according to the records from real-world environments.
Different from normal speaker architecture, it does not have a traditional diaphragm.
It produces sounds by vibrating the large scale hard medium. 
In other words, the resonant speaker can convert the audio signal into structural vibration.

Under the excitation, the piezoelectric transducer outputs an irregular fluctuating voltage, common ac-to-dc rectifier (**SEH**) can be connected for converting the voltage into dc, in order to power the digital electronics.
In this work, SP (self-power)-paralle-SSHI, SP-series-SSHI, and SP-SECE are also provided.
