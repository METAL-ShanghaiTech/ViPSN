# ViPSN
ViPSN is a vibration-powered sensing node as a programmable IoT platform for battery-free sensing and transmitting. It leverages the exploitation and utilization of ambient vibration energy by using a piezoelectric transducer. The study on ViPSN provides a new paradigm for the design and operation of the battery-free IoT systems based on vibration energy harvesting technology.
