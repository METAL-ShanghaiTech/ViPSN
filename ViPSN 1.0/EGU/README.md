## Energy Generation Unit (EGU)
For EGU, a commercial portable resonance speaker serves as the vibrator.
It generates vibrations according to the records from real-world environments. 
It is self-contained with a battery pack inside and standard auxiliary port (AUX) for audio input. 
Different from a normal loudspeaker, it does not have a diaphragm. 
It produces sounds by vibrating the contacting hard medium. 
In other words, a resonance speaker can convert the audio signal into structural vibration.
Compared with the expensive and heavy professional vibrator, this portable solution is a better option for the developer working on vibration-powered IoT applications.

### Specification
In this project, we provided a script (acc2wav.m) to convert vibration acceleration data into audio signals.
